So I've been working on this app. Application bundling is a whole another story. Thanks to modern AI systems, I've been able to pull together a working product in a matter of months. The only thing is , I am not a Frontend guy. No history whatsoever of designing a full fledged frontend webapps. The only thing I know is HTML/CSS and a bit of JS. (did a short react course years ago and have managed to pull up static websites using jekyll but that's pretty much it).


A quick glimse of what I've been working on.

![app]({{ site.url }}/assets/graphics/buckbuck_demo.jpeg)

and I'm thiking of calling it BuckBuck.ai. 
Now on logo designing part, I have been fiddleing around with these svg editors available online. But I want to understand the basics of how these things work. For new designers (nto sure if I can call myself one) , it's always a good idea to understand the basics of design.
But it always starts with playng around with colors , fonts and typography.

I have been a fan of this Germany based free tool called [schultzschultz](https://schultzschultz.com/) . The *vibe* I think I'm going for is

Vs

![sample](../assets/graphics/buck_logo2.png)

I don't know if it is any good. But I like it as a start. And btw what the heck is that?

#### Design
I've always been into design. The idea intrigues me. There is no definition of what term design amounts to. But I feel it's a combination of pretty much everything ranging from color theory, typography, layout, user experience and so on.


#### So
I decided to take a short detour and understand the basics of modern web design. So that's what I'm spending this weekend on.

### SVG 

or Scalable Vector Graphics [^1] is an XML based markup language for describing two dimensional vector graphics. Unlike raster images which are pixel based, SVGs are vector based and hence can be scaled to any size without loss of quality. This makes them ideal for web use where images need to be displayed on a variety of devices with different screen sizes and resolutions.

fun thing is: they are programmable. You can create and manipulate SVG images using code.

The SVG format supports a wide range of features including shapes, paths, text, gradients, and filters. It also supports interactivity and animation, making it a powerful tool for creating dynamic graphics on the web.

----

- SVGs are very powerful and flexible tools in designing web graphics. Combined with animations and css, it's just a matter of time before you can create some really cool stuff.


### So how it works?

We define an svg element with its `width` and `height` properties. This defines the drawing canvas where the coordinates go from the 0,0 coordinate from the `top-left` corner and grow downwards and to the right. 

This is like a cartesian plane but with y axis inverted.


In whole `<html> <head>` structure of a webpage, SVGs are embedded just using a `<svg>` tag. 

Basic structure steps of creating an SVG graphics.[^2]

```html
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <!-- Canvs -->
</svg>
```


Next we start filling the canvas with shapes. The most basic shape is a rectangle. 



----


![app]({{ site.url }}/assets/graphics/rectangle.svg){: .left width="200px" height="200px"}

 Simple rectangle with x,y coordinates `x 10 y 10` in a box of height and width `200`

```html
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <rect x="10" y="10" width="50" height="50" fill="blue" />
</svg>
```

-----
<br> 



![app]({{ site.url }}/assets/graphics/circle.svg){: .right width="250px" height="250px"}














----
```html
<svg width="200" height="200">
  <circle
    cx="100"
    cy="120"
    r="70"
  />
</svg>
```

-----


Finally to add some colour, use `fill` property. Can use hex codes or rgb values or simply color names.

![elements]({{ site.url }}/assets/graphics/elements.png){: .right width="300px" height="300px"}

1. [SVG Tutorial](https://svg-tutorial.com/) gives an in depth overview of svg elements along with examples ranging from basic to advanced topics.

Best to play around with it. (editable codepen below). Like the great man once said , "Edit and rerun. Conquer the world."

---

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="OPyqJRG" data-pen-title="Untitled" data-editable="true" data-user="vKoder" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/vKoder/pen/OPyqJRG">
  Untitled</a> by Vaibhav (<a href="https://codepen.io/vKoder">@vKoder</a>)

</p>

Now for more complicated shapes, we don't always use coordianate system tarting from top left `0, 0` . We use something called `viewbox` , to define a coordinate system.

![viewbox]({{ site.url }}/assets/graphics/viewbox.png){: .right width="400px" height="400px"}

So in essence, it's to define the area of the canvas and then `shift` the starting point/point of reference.

**viewbox** attribute is defined as `{ min-x ,min-y } { width ,height }` where `min-x` and `min-y` define the top left corner of the viewbox and `width` and `height` define the dimensions of the viewbox.

- This even helps in `scaling` the contents inside the viewbox. So for a canvas dimension of `200 x 200` , if we define a viewbox of `0 0 100 100` , the contents inside the viewbox will be scaled to fit the canvas i.e. `100 x 100` viewbox will be scaled to fit `200 x 200` canvas.

### Paths and Splines

Paths are the most powerful and complex element in SVG. They are used to create complex shapes and curves that cannot be created using basic shapes like rectangles and circles. Paths are defined using a series of commands and parameters that describe the shape of the path.

So what do I mean by that?

----

```html 
<svg
  width="200"
  height="200"
  viewBox="-100 -100 200 200"
><rect x="-100" y="-100" width="200" height="200" 
fill="white"/>
  <path
    d="
        M -45, -45
        L  45, -45"
    stroke="#ab2727ff"
    stroke-width="15"
    stroke-linecap="round"
  />
</svg>
```
{: .right width="200px" height="200px"}

<br>
<br>

<svg
  width="200"
  height="200"
  viewBox="-100 -100 200 200"
><rect x="-100" y="-100" width="200" height="200" fill="white"/>
  <path
    d="
        M -45, -45
        L  45, -45"
    stroke="#ab2727ff"
    stroke-width="15"
    stroke-linecap="round"
  />
</svg>
